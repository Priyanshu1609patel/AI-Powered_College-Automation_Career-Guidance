 Industry Defined Project (IDP): IDP is a category of the project in which
individual student or groups works for their industry defined problem definition
within the industry premises.
 User Defined Project (UDP): UDP is the category of project in which a group or
individual student decides to make their own project under the mentorship of internal
guide.
(B) Selection of Group, Definition, Tutorial:
 Selection of Group: The number of students per group for a project has to be
decided with prior approval of Project/ Subject Coordinator.
 Project Definition: Student is expected to search the Project Definition.
 Tutorial: It should be used for discussion on project types, technologies and design
of the project.
(C) Learning and Progress:
 Literature survey/Analysis: The student is advised to do some case study in form
of Literature Review/Analysis related to the Previous Projects/Problems.
 Methodology/Software tools: Student is expected to figure out specifications,
methodology, resources required, critical issues involved in software design and for
project development.

===== PAGE 218 =====
